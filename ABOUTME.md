## Why I am interested. 
    I really enjoy creating custom projects at home with an online group that include rhythm game aspects. 
    An example of what I have made before is this: https://youtu.be/4OJntuAHjKk

    I am very passionate about projects like this. 

## What I hope to learn in Computer Science. 
    I am really hoping to expand my knowledge of hardware as well as discover more languages to work in. 

## What I hope to learn in Cyber Security. 
    I have always wanted to start a server, but I am not too sure how to protect it so I can share it
    with trusted people. 

## Other hobbies than Computers. 
    I don't have many other hobbies than computers, but I do have one important one I like. 
    I enjoy going to the shooting range and testing out my accuracy. 

## My main role models. 
### My father who passed away a few years back.

### My mother who has done so much for me.

    I don't really have anyone else to list here since I don't really like celebrities. 
    Besides, these two are or were the most important people of my life.
